# Python Interactive SHell

Python Interactive SHell or PISH is a shell written completely in python using default python modules.

It is a hobbie project I would like to work with when I am bored.

All commands are seperated into `.py` files for easy organization at the end when combining into the `main.py` file.

The goal of this project is to make a minimalist shell using python, the shell is not targeted towards beginners.
