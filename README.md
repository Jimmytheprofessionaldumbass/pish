# Python Interactive SHell

Python Interactive SHell or PISH is a shell written completely in python using default python modules.

It is a hobbie project I would like to work with when I am bored.

All commands are defined as functions and saved as a .python file for every individual function for easy organization.

The goal of this project is to make the pish as much features as possible in the least amount of code as well as a very easy to use shell. Basically bash but easier. I am having second thoughts about the name of this shell, I am thinking of naming it PSH or BABETUSHIP for BAsh But Easier To Use SHell In Python.
