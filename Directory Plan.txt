I am doing this so that it doesn't get to confused when I am creating the directories.
Manny commands have different names for excecuting them but does the exact same thing

Basic Functions
  Navigation
    wai.py (outputs working directory)
    lf.py (lists files in current directory)
    gt.py (changes current working directory)
  Creating Changes
    rn.py (renames files)
    dp.py (duplicates item)
    mi.py (moves item)
    ri.py (removes item)
    md.py (makes directories)
  Help
    mn.py (shows the manual)
    hp.py (shows help)
    fc.py (helps user find a command don't know the name of)
